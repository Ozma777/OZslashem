# OZslashem
my stuff and what I like from everyone else in my stuff

So my GOAL is to fill EVERY letter of character classes and add a bunch more races but keep this more like the original slash'em
(52 classes in all) and I have added the "change questions order" patch so that if there are too many races with the same
starting letter (but different alignments) you can select them

Slashem Extended added a-z and A-Z but I want to make it easier (and keep the old way even though it is more trouble) by
adding that patch

I LOVE Slashem-Extended and she has helped me a whole lot when I get stuck, but I want this to be my own personal slashem
AND maybe a bridge between vanilla slashem and the VASTLY different and MUCH MORE COOL slashem extended.

I hope to have random dungeon colors (Mines and Special Levels and Dungeons) with random ice, trees, water, etc through all
I am going to make more towns and maybe dungeon towns and sokobans too.
Most of my classes and quests have been made by me.
I hope to eventually get lots of dNethack in it (wards, races, classes, seals, etc.)
I eventually want a slashem that is very close to vanilla but just a bit different and a bit harder too
MAGES are set for 5 (chinese zodiac elements) Fire, Water, Earth, Metal (lightning), Wood (air). (mostly works so far)

Unfortunately I have some compiler errors that are serious enough to NOT have line numbers just hex and stuff so I have some stuff
to figure out before I can continue.

This page WILL contain OzSlashem (did not know what to call it and it was suggested Oz because of my username)

I have to make it MOSTLY finished FIRST and then it will be here.

Thanks especially to AmyBSOD for helping me with ALL my questions.

Thanks to all the patch makers, UnNethack, Slash-them, Slashem-extended (I almost gave up when I saw what you had completed, but I have to go on to make my imagined game a reality), dNethack, Grunthack, dynahack, nethack-the next generation, nethack-fourk (although I was never to play this online for more than a day, I put your races in), nethack, hack, rogue, and any other fork I have played throughout the many years I have been into this game (since I was 9 years old) whether or not I have used your code or someone else's version of your code or whatnot, Thank you in advance.

And thanks to ADOM for getting me to see that a lot CAN be accomplished with a text based game.

I intend to eventually get ALL the dNethack functionality (A LOT OF WORK YES), but his game has SO many features that slashem is lacking and SYBERIA was my favorite game while I had just discovered his game so the races (including clockwork-automatons) first, then the other stuff.

(OF COURSE) this will be LONG after I finally finish the first version of this game and upload it here that I even ATTEMPT to get working dNethack crossovers.
