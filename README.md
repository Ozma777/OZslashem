# OZslashem
my stuff and what I like from everyone else in my stuff

This page WILL contain OzSlashem (did not know what to call it and it was suggested Oz because of my username)

I have to make it MOSTLY finished FIRST and then it will be here.

Thanks especially to AmyBSOD for helping me with ALL my questions.

Thanks to all the patch makers, UnNethack, Slash-them, Slashem-extended (I almost gave up when I saw what you had completed, but I have to go on to make my imagined game a reality), dNethack, Grunthack, dynahack, nethack-the next generation, nethack-fourk (although I was never to play this online for more than a day, I put your races in), nethack, hack, rogue, and any other fork I have played throughout the many years I have been into this game (since I was 9 years old) whether or not I have used your code or someone else's version of your code or whatnot, Thank you in advance.

And thanks to ADOM for getting me to see that a lot CAN be accomplished with a text based game.

I intend to eventually get ALL the dNethack functionality (A LOT OF WORK YES), but his game has SO many features that slashem is lacking and SYBERIA was my favorite game while I had just discovered his game so the races (including clockwork-automatons) first, then the other stuff.

(OF COURSE) this will be LONG after I finally finish the first version of this game and upload it here that I even ATTEMPT to get working dNethack crossovers.
