	greed and avarice that plagues so many of that otherwise noble
	race. He is a hunched, twisted creature, warped by his own
	greeds, jealousies, and desires. Like many other deities, his
	name is often invoked by followers of other gods to keep him away
	from one's treasure.
	For it had been long apparent to Count Landulf that nothing
	could be done with his seventh son Thomas, except to make him
	an Abbot or something of that kind.  Born in 1226, he had from
	childhood a mysterious objection to becoming a predatory eagle,
	or even to taking an ordinary interest in falconry or tilting
	or any other gentlemanly pursuits.  He was a large and heavy and
	quiet boy, and phenomenally silent, scarcely opening his mouth
	except to say suddenly to his schoolmaster in an explosive
	manner, "What is God?"  The answer is not recorded but it is
	probable that the asker went on worrying out answers for himself.

	Aerdrie  Faenya is the elven goddess of air and weather. As a rain-
	bringer, she is revered as a source of fertility.  She is, however,
	perceived as a somewhat distant  goddess, and the fact that she  is
	also revered by some aarakocra slightly diminishes the  strength of
	elven  devotion to  her (as does  her definite  neutral tendency in
	alignment). The goddess  herself takes  delight in  the freedom  of
	the skies, the music  of wind instruments,  and (sometimes)  fairly
	severe and  violent thunderstorms. She is  friendly to all  avians,
	aarakocra, ki-rin, and lammasu.

	humanoids,  and hawk-like humanoids respectively. Although there is
	a distinct  hierarchy among the varieties,  there is  no rivalry or

	Ashikaga Takauji was a daimyo of the Minamoto clan who
	joined forces with the Go-Daigo to defeat the Hojo armies.
	Later when Go-Daigo attempted to reduce the powers of the
	samurai clans he rebelled against him.  He defeated Go-
	Daigo and established the emperor Komyo on the throne.
	Go-Daigo eventually escaped and established another
	government in the town of Yoshino.  This period of dual
	governments was known as the Nambokucho.

	On July 8, 1336,  he and his samurai entered Kyoto, forced Go-Daigo

	are  the   descendants  of  this   puppet  emperor  that   Ashikaga

	and  opened a new "capital"  in Yoshino (south of  Kyoto), where he
	and few  of his  descendants claimed  to be  running a  government,
	known as  the "Southern Court". The  period between  1337 and 1392,
	when Japan was ruled by two courts, is known as the Nambokucho.

	That "government" disappeared, naturally, after a  few generations,
	and Ashikaga's  Muromachi regime lasted for  a long  time. The last
	Ashikaga daimyo in power was the 14th descendant of Takauji.

	In 1927, zoologist Ernst Bartels was in his home near the 
	Tjidjenkol River in Java when he heard a strange cry louder than 
	the other night sounds, a cry like "a-hool."
	Bartels heard the sound twice more before the origin of the cries 
	moved off into the night. Bartels soon remembered a local legend 
	of the ahool or athol, a type of huge bat reputed to live in 
	the area.

	Locals described the bat as the size of a small child, with 
	an 11-12 foot wingspan. The athol was supposedly covered in 
	grayish fur and had a face similar to that of a monkey or a man. 
	At times, it was seen sitting on the forest floor, with its wings 
	folded beside it; it was also reputed to have feet which pointed
	backwards. During the day (like all bats, it was nocturnal), the 
	athol's refuge was supposedly a cave somewhere near a waterfall, 
	although at night it would fly over the river's surface in
	search of fish.

 		quietly,  "is  small,  yellow  and  leech-like, and probably the

 		from  its  carrier  but  from  those around  it.  It absorbs all
 		unconscious mental frequencies  from this  brainwave  energy  to
 		nourish  itself  with.  It then  excretes  into  the mind of its
 		carrier a telepathic matrix formed  by  combining the  conscious
 		thought frequencies with nerve signals picked up from the speech
 		centres of the brain which  has  supplied  them.  The  practical
 		upshot of all this is that if you stick a Babel fish in your ear

	large number, led a semi-independent life of their
	own.  Several were currently hovering above the table.

	Bugbears are relatives of goblins, although they tend to be
	larger and more hairy.  They are aggressive carnivores and
	sometimes kill just for the treasure their victims may be
	carrying.

	Bugbears are giant, hairy  cousins of goblins who frequent the same
	areas  as  their smaller  relatives.  Bugbears are  large and  very
	muscular, standing 7' tall.  Their hides range from light yellow to
	yellow brown  and their  thick coarse  hair varies  in colour  from
	brown  to  brick  red.  Though  vaguely   humanoid  in  appearance,
	bugbears seem to contain the  blood of some large  carnivore. Their
	eyes recall  those of  some savage  bestial animal, being  greenish
	white with  red pupils, while their  ears are  wedge shaped, rising
	from the  top of  their heads. A  bugbear's mouth  is full of  long
	sharp fangs.
	Bugbears have two main goals  in life: survival and  treasure. They
	are  superb  carnivores,  winnowing  out  the   weak  and  careless
	adventurer, monster, and animal. Goblins  are always on  their toes
	when  bugbears are present, for  the weak or  stupid quickly end up
	in the stewpot.

	Only once a year, on his birthday, did Charlie Bucket ever
	get to taste a bit of chocolate.  The whole family saved up
	their money for that special occasion, and when the great
	day arrived, Charlie was always presented with one small
	chocolate bar to eat all by himself.  And each time he
	received it, on those marvelous birthday mornings, he would
	place it carefully in a small wooden box that he owned, and
	treasure it as though it were a bar of solid gold; and for
	the next few days, he would allow himself only to look at it,
	but never to touch it.  Then at last, when he could stand it
	no longer, he would peel back a tiny bit of the paper
	wrapping at one corner to expose a tiny bit of chocolate, and
	then he would take a tiny nibble - just enough to allow the
	lovely sweet taste to spread out slowly over his tongue.  The
	next day, he would take another tiny nibble, and so on, and
	so on.  And in this way, Charlie would make his ten-cent bar
	of birthday chocolate last him for more than a month.

	Imagine a sealed container, so perfectly constructed that no
	physical influence can pass either inwards or outwards across its
	walls.  Imagine that inside the container is a cat, and also a
	device that can be triggered by some quantum event.  If that event
	takes place, then the device smashes a phial containing cyanide and
	the cat is killed.  If the event does not take place, the cat lives
	on.  In Schroedinger's original version, the quantum event was the
	decay of a radioactive atom.  ...  To the outside observer, the cat
	is indeed in a linear combination of being alive and dead, and only
	when the container is finally opened would the cat's state vector
	collapse into one or the other.  On the other hand, to a (suitably
	protected) observer inside the container, the cat's state-vector
	would have collapsed much earlier, and the outside observer's
	linear combination has no relevance.

	Now it was light enough to leave.  Moon-Watcher picked up
	the shriveled corpse and dragged it after him as he bent
	under the low overhang of the cave.  Once outside, he
	threw the body over his shoulder and stood upright - the
	only animal in all this world able to do so.
	Among his kind, Moon-Watcher was almost a giant.  He was
	nearly five feet high, and though badly undernourished
	weighed over a hundred pounds.  His hairy, muscular body
	was halfway between ape and man, but his head was already
	much nearer to man than ape.  The forehead was low, and
	there were ridges over the eye sockets, yet he unmistakably
	held in his genes the promise of humanity.

	Of all the monsters put together by the Greek imagination
	the Centaurs (Kentauroi) constituted a class in themselves.
	Despite a strong streak of sensuality, in their make-up,
	their normal behaviour was moral, and they took a kindly
	thought of man's welfare.  The attempted outrage of Nessos on
	Deianeira, and that of the whole tribe of Centaurs on the
	Lapith women, are more than offset by the hospitality of
	Pholos and by the wisdom of Cheiron, physician, prophet,
	lyrist, and the instructor of Achilles.  Further, the
	Centaurs were peculiar in that their nature, which united the
	body of a horse with the trunk and head of a man, involved
	an unthinkable duplication of vital organs and important
	members.  So grotesque a combination seems almost un-Greek.
	These strange creatures were said to live in the caves and
	clefts of the mountains, myths associating them especially
	with the hills of Thessaly and the range of Erymanthos.

	Dantes rapidly cleared away the earth around the chest.  Soon
	the center lock appeared, then the handles at each end, all
	delicately wrought in the manner of that period when art made
	precious even the basest of metals.  He took the chest by the
	two handles and tried to lift it, but it was impossible.  He
	tried to open it; it was locked.  He inserted the sharp end
	of his pickaxe between the chest and the lid and pushed down
	on the handle.  The lid creaked, then flew open.
	Dantes was seized with a sort of giddy fever.  He cocked his
	gun and placed it beside him.  The he closed his eyes like a
	child, opened them and stood dumbfounded.
	The chest was divided into three compartments.  In the first
	were shining gold coins.  In the second, unpolished gold
	ingots packed in orderly stacks.  From the third compartment,

	Once in a great while, when the positions of the stars are

	along will come a snake, to coil around the egg, or a toad,
	to squat upon the egg, keeping it warm and helping it to
	hatch.  When it hatches, out comes a creature called basilisk,

	glance from its yellow, piercing toad's eyes will kill both

	There is, however, one creature which can withstand the

 		"The time is nearly upon us," said one, and Arthur was surprised
 		to see a word suddenly materialize in thin air just by the man's
 		neck. The word was Loonquawl, and it flashed a couple  of  times
 		and then disappeared again. Before Arthur was able to assimilate
 		this the other man spoke and the word  Phouchg  appeared by  his
 		neck.
  
 		"Seventy-five thousand generations ago, our ancestors  set  this
 		program in motion," the second man said,"and in all that time we
 		will be the first to hear the computer speak."
  
 		"An awesome prospect, Phouchg," agreed the first man, and Arthur
 		suddenly   realized   that  he  was  watching  a recording  with
 		subtitles.
  
 		"We are the ones who will hear," said Phouchg,"the answer to the
 		great question of Life ...!"
  
 		"The Universe ...!" said Loonquawl.
  
 		"And Everything ...!"
  
 		"Shhh," said Loonquawl with  a  slight  gesture, "I  think  Deep
 		Thought is preparing to speak!"
  
 		There was a  moment's expectant  pause whilst panels slowly came
 		to life on the front of  the  console. Lights flashed on and off
 		experimentally and settled down into a businesslike  pattern.  A
 		soft low hum came from the communication channel.
  
 		"Good morning," said Deep Thought at last.
  
 		"Er ... Good morning, O Deep Thought," said Loonquawl nervously,
 		"do you have ... er, that is ..."
  
 		"An answer for you?" interrupted Deep Thought majestically."Yes.
 		I have."
 
 		The two men shivered with expectancy. Their waiting had not been
 		in vain.
  
 		"There really is one?" breathed Phouchg.
  
 		"There really is one," confirmed Deep Thought.
  
 		"To Everything? To the great Question of Life, the  Universe and
 		Everything?"
  
 		"Yes."
  
 		Both of the men had been trained for this moment,their lives had
 		been  a  preparation  for it, they had been selected at birth as
 		those who would witness the  answer,  but  even  so  they  found
 		themselves gasping and squirming like excited children.
  
 		"And you're ready to give it to us?" urged Loonquawl.
  
 		"I am."
  
 		"Now?"
  
 		"Now," said Deep Thought.
  
 		They both licked their dry lips.
  
 		"Though I don't think," added Deep Thought,"that you're going to
 		like it."
  
 		"Doesn't matter!" said Phouchg. "We must know it! Now!"
  
 		"Now?" inquired Deep Thought.
  
 		"Yes! Now ..."
  
 		"Alright," said the computer and settled into silence again. The
 		two men fidgeted. The tension was unbearable.
  
 		"You're really not going to like it," observed Deep Thought.
  
 		"Tell us!"
  
 		"Alright," said Deep Thought. "The Answer to the  Great Question
 		..."
  
 		"Yes ...!"
  
 		"Of Life, the Universe and Everything ..." said Deep Thought.
  
 		"Yes ...!"
  
 		"Is ..." said Deep Thought, and paused.
  
 		"Yes ...!"

	It is often very hard to discover what any given Demon looks

	In the West the dragon was the natural enemy of man.  Although
	preferring to live in bleak and desolate regions, whenever it
	was seen among men it left in its wake a trail of destruction
	and disease.  Yet any attempt to slay this beast was a perilous
	undertaking.  For the dragon's assailant had to contend
	not only with clouds of sulphurous fumes pouring from its fire
	breathing nostrils, but also with the thrashings of its tail,
	the most deadly part of its serpent-like body.

	Dwarfs have faces like men (ugly men, with wrinkled, leathery

	have feet pointing backwards.  They are of the earth, earthy,

	and others disguised as toads.  Miners often come across them,
	and sometimes establish reasonably close relations with them.

	Among other things, dwarfs are rightly valued for their skill

	Gungnir, and Thor his hammer; for Freya they designed a

	Rest! This little Fountain runs
	Thus for aye: -- It never stays
	For the look of summer suns,
	Nor the cold of winter days.
	Whose'er shall wander near,
	When the Syrian heat is worst,
	Let him hither come, nor fear
	Lest he may not slake his thirst:
	He will find this little river
	Running still, as bright as ever.
	Let him drink, and onward hie,
	Bearing but in thought, that I,
	Erotas, bade the Naiad fall,
	And thank the great god Pan for all!

	One hot summer's day a Fox was strolling through an orchard till he
	came to a bunch of Grapes just ripening on a vine which had been
	trained over a lofty branch. "Just the thing to quench my thirst,"
	quoth he. Drawing back a few paces, he took a run and a jump, and
	just missed the bunch. Turning round again with a One, Two, Three, he
	jumped up, but with no greater success. Again and again he tried
	after the tempting morsel, but at last had to give it up, and walked
	away with his nose in the air, saying: "I am sure they are sour."

	Later on, at the time of wheat harvest, Samson took a young goat
	and went to visit his wife. He said, "I'm going to my wife's
	room."  But her father would not let him go in.
	"I was so sure you thoroughly hated her," he said, "that I gave
	her to your friend. Isn't her younger sister more attractive? Take
	her instead."
	Samson said to them, "This time I have a right to get even with
	the Philistines; I will really harm them." So he went out and
	caught three hundred foxes and tied them tail to tail in pairs. He
	then fastened a torch to every pair of tails, lit the torches and
	let the foxes loose in the standing grain of the Philistines.

	Fungi, division of simple plants that lack chlorophyll, true
	stems, roots, and leaves.  Unlike algae, fungi cannot
	photosynthesize, and live as parasites or saprophytes.  The
	division comprises the slime molds and true fungi.  True
	fungi are multicellular (with the exception of yeasts); the
	body of most true fungi consists of slender cottony
	filaments, or hyphae.  All fungi are capable of asexual
	reproduction by cell division, budding, fragmentation, or
	spores.  Those that reproduce sexually alternate a sexual
	generation (gametophyte) with a spore-producing one.  The
	four classes of true fungi are the algaelike fungi (e.g.,
	black bread mold and downy mildew), sac fungi (e.g., yeasts,
	powdery mildews, truffles, and blue and green molds such as
	Penicillium), basidium fungi (e.g., mushrooms and puffballs)
	and imperfect fungi (e.g., species that cause athlete's foot
	and ringworm).  Fungi help decompose organic matter (important
	in soil renewal); are valuable as a source of antibiotics,
	vitamins, and various chemicals; and for their role in
	fermentation, e.g., in bread and alcoholic beverage
	production.

	And so it came to pass that while Man ruled on Earth, the
	gargoyles waited, lurking, hidden from the light.  Reborn
	every 600 years in Man's reckoning of time, the gargoyles
	joined battle against Man to gain dominion over the Earth.

	In each coming, the gargoyles were nearly destroyed by Men
	who flourished in greater numbers.  Now it has been so many
	hundreds of years that it seems the ancient statues and
	paintings of gargoyles are just products of Man's
	imagination.  In this year, with Man's thoughts turned toward
	the many ills he has brought among himself, Man has forgotten
	his most ancient adversary, the gargoyles.

	1 November - All day long we have travelled, and at a good
	speed.  The horses seem to know that they are being kindly
	treated, for they go willingly their full stage at best
	speed.  We have now had so many changes and find the same
	thing so constantly that we are encouraged to think that the
	journey will be an easy one.  Dr. Van Helsing is laconic, he
	tells the farmers that he is hurrying to Bistritz, and pays
	them well to make the exchange of horses.  We get hot soup,
	or coffee, or tea, and off we go.  It is a lovely country.
	Full of beauties of all imaginable kinds, and the people are
	brave, and strong, and simple, and seem full of nice
	qualities.  They are very, very superstitious.  In the first
	house where we stopped, when the woman who served us saw the
	scar on my forehead, she crossed herself and put out two
	fingers towards me, to keep off the evil eye.  I believe they
	went to the trouble of putting an extra amount of garlic into
	our food, and I can't abide garlic.  Ever since then I have
	taken care not to take off my hat or veil, and so have
	escaped their suspicions.
		[ Dracula, by Bram Stoker ]
	Geryon is an arch-devil sometimes called the Wild Beast,
	attacking with his claws and poison sting.  His ranking in
	Hell is rumored to be quite low.
	And now the souls of the dead who had gone below came swarming
	up from Erebus -- fresh brides, unmarried youths, old men
	with life's long suffering behind them, tender young girls
	still nursing this first anguish in their hearts, and a great
	throng of warriors killed in battle, their spear-wounds gaping
	yet and all their armour stained with blood.  From this
	multitude of souls, as they fluttered to and fro by the
	trench, there came a moaning that was horrible to hear.
	Panic drained the blood from my cheeks.
		 [ The Odyssey, (chapter Lambda), by Homer ]
	The forces of the gloom know each other, and are strangely
	balanced by each other.  Teeth and claws fear what they cannot
	grasp.  Blood-drinking bestiality, voracious appetites, hunger
	in search of prey, the armed instincts of nails and jaws which
	have for source and aim the belly, glare and smell out
	uneasily the impassive spectral forms straying beneath a
	shroud, erect in its vague and shuddering robe, and which seem
	to them to live with a dead and terrible life.  These
	brutalities, which are only matter, entertain a confused fear
	of having to deal with the immense obscurity condensed into an
	unknown being.  A black figure barring the way stops the wild
	beast short.  That which emerges from the cemetery intimidates
	and disconcerts that which emerges from the cave; the
	ferocious fear the sinister; wolves recoil when they encounter
	a ghoul.

	Giants have always walked the earth, though they are rare in
	these times.  They range in size from little over nine feet
	to a towering twenty feet or more.  The larger ones use huge
	boulders as weapons, hurling them over large distances.  All
	types of giants share a love for men - roasted, boiled, or
	fried.  Their table manners are legendary.
	[Gila monsters] are stout-bodied lizards with short legs and a short,
	fat tail. They're covered with bright irregular markings, usually
	pink, yellow or white, against black or brown scales. They are shy,
	retiring creatures unless they're provoked. Then they can be
	dangerous because they secrete a neurotoxin -- a poison that
	destroys nerve tissue -- from their salivary glands. In humans,
	their bite can result in severe pain and even death.
	    [Expedition Guide -- American Museum of Natural History]
	The people of Komodo call this animal "ora." Elsewhere it is known
	as the Komodo Island monitor or more popularly, the Komodo dragon.
	Oras can reach 10 feet in length and weigh 300 pounds or more --
	particularly after a meal. They are the top predators in their
	habitat, feeding on wild boar, deer, water buffalo, dogs, goats,
	rats, snakes, birds, other oras, and -- once in a great while --
	humans. They hunt by ambush, hiding in the scrub brush along trails
	and in the tall grass of the savannas. Despite their lumbering
	appearance, oras can move with alarming speed when they want to,
	lunging from their hiding places and sprinting toward their
	startled victims. They can't sustain a long chase, but often all
	they need to subdue their prey is one bite. Oras carry poisonous
	bacteria in their mouths so even if they don't immediately catch
	their prey, the attack is often fatal. Using their long forked
	tongues (oras and other monitor lizards are closely related to
	snakes), they track the scent of their prey as the wounded animal
	slowly weakens from the infected bite -- a process that can take
	several days. When the victim can no longer flee, the ora moves
	in for the kill. Oras are voracious eaters. They devour every bit
	of their prey -- bones, fur, hooves -- ripping off huge chunks with
	their razor-sharp serrated teeth and swallowing the pieces whole.

	The glaive is a knife-bladed spear. It has the thrusting 
	function of the spear, and the secondary cutting function of 
	the convex blade of the knife. The weapon was rapidly enlarged 
	in the blade in order to give it a greater cutting function as 
	well as a cleaving attack. As with a spear or fauchard, however, 
	it is not overly effective at holding opponents back, nor does 
	it have the piercing or dismounting capabilities.
	Far beneath the surface of the earth dwell the Svirfneblin, or Deep
	Gnomes. Small parties of these demihumans roam the Underdark's mazes
	of small passageways searching for gemstones. They are said to dwell
	in great cities consisting of a closely connected series of tunnels,
	buildings, and caverns in which up to a thousand of these diminutive
	creatures live. They keep the location of these hidden cities secret
	in order to protect them from their deadly foes, the kuo-toa, Drow,
	and mind flayers.
	Svirfneblin are slightly smaller than rock gnomes, but their thin,
	wiry, gnarled frames are just as strong. Their skin is rock-colored,
	usually medium brown to brownish gray, and their eyes are gray. Male
	svirfneblin are completely bald; female deep gnomes have stringy gray
	hair. The average svirfneblin life span is 250 years.

	...  And then a gnome came by, carrying a bundle, an old
	fellow three times as large as an imp and wearing clothes of
	a sort, especially a hat.  And he was clearly just as frightened
	as the imps though he could not go so fast.  Ramon Alonzo
	saw that there must be some great trouble that was vexing
	magical things; and, since gnomes speak the language of men, and
	will answer if spoken to gently, he raised his hat, and asked
	of the gnome his name.  The gnome did not stop his hasty
	shuffle a moment as he answered 'Alaraba' and grabbed the rim
	of his hat but forgot to doff it.
	'What is the trouble, Alaraba?'  said Ramon Alonzo.
	'White magic.  Run!'  said the gnome ..

 	"Yeah, I've seen those things they think are gnomes," said Ron,
 	bent double with his head in a peony bush, "like fat little
 	Santa Clauses with fishing rods..."
 	There was a violent scuffling noise, the peony bush shuddered,
 	and Ron straightened up.  "This is a gnome," he said grimly.
 	"Geroff me! Gerroff me!" squealed the gnome.
 	It was certainly nothing like Santa Claus.  It was small and
 	leathery looking, with a large, knobby, bald head exactly like

 	with its horny little feet; he grasped it around the ankles
 	and turned it upside down.

	the air of having been made by a committee.  But all Goddesses
	and Gods, whether they say they made the world or not, have
	very detailed short-term plans for it which they are determined
	to carry out.  Consequently they tend to push people into the

	"The original story harks back, so they say, to the sixteenth
	century.  Using long-lost formulas from the Kabbala, a rabbi is
	said to have made an artificial man -- the so-called Golem -- to
	help ring the bells in the Synagogue and for all kinds of other
	menial work.
	"But he hadn't made a full man, and it was animated by some sort
	of vegetable half-life.  What life it had, too, so the story
	runs, was only derived from the magic charm placed behind its
	teeth each day, that drew down to itself what was known as the
	`free sidereal strength of the universe.'
	"One evening, before evening prayers, the rabbi forgot to take
	the charm out of the Golem's mouth, and it fell into a frenzy.
	It raged through the dark streets, smashing everything in its
	path, until the rabbi caught up with it, removed the charm, and

	This form of a pole axe is seen as a convex-headed broad axe 
	in early examples, but the head is set at a convenient angle, 
	considering the point where the blade is most likely to impact

	ordinary long-hafted axe. The whole weapon reaches 8 feet in length, 
	and is nearly always topped with a long spear point and backed by 
	a spike, which was often angled or hooked slightly downward. 
	The spear point is, of course, designed to keep opponents at bay 
	and deliver a thrusting attack (this proves quite useless when 
	opposing mounted knights armed with lances). The opposing spike was 
	for penetration of heavy plate armor, with a secondary function as a

		Those that Hobgoblin call you, and sweet Puck,
		You do their work, and they shall have good luck:
		Are you not he?
	and obviously Puck would not wish to be called a hobgoblin
	if that was an ill-omened word.
	Hobgoblins are on the whole, good-humoured and ready to be
	helpful, but fond of practical joking, and like most of the
	fairies rather nasty people to annoy.  Boggarts hover on the
	verge of hobgoblindom.  Bogles are just over the edge.
	One Hob mentioned by Henderson, was Hob Headless who haunted
	the road between Hurworth and Neasham, but could not cross
	the little river Kent, which flowed into the Tess.  He was
	exorcised and laid under a large stone by the roadside for
	ninety-nine years and a day.  If anyone was so unwary as to
	sit on that stone, he would be unable to quit it for ever.
	The ninety-nine years is nearly up, so trouble may soon be
	heard of on the road between Hurworth and Neasham.

	"We want a word with you," said Ligur (in a tone of voice
	intended to imply that "word" was synonymous with "horrifically
	painful eternity"), and the squat demon pushed open the office
	door.
	The bucket teetered, then fell neatly on Ligur's head.
	Drop a lump of sodium in water.  Watch it flame and burn and
	spin around crazily, flaring and sputtering.  This was like
	that, just nastier.
	The demon peeled and flared and flickered.  Oily brown smoke
	oozed from it, and it screamed and it screamed and it screamed.
	Then it crumpled, folded in on itself, and what was left lay
	glistening on the burnt and blackened circle of carpet, looking
	like a handful of mashed slugs.
	"Hi," said Crowley to Hastur, who had been walking behind Ligur,
	and had unfortunately not been so much as splashed.
	There are some things that are unthinkable; there are some
	depths that not even demons would believe other demons would

	A homunculus is a creature summoned by a mage to perform some
	particular task.  They are particularly good at spying.  They
	are smallish creatures, but very agile.  They can put their
	victims to sleep with a venomous bite, but due to their size,
	the effect does not last long on humans.

	But as for Queequeg -- why, Queequeg sat there among them --
	at the head of the table, too, it so chanced; as cool as an

	there without ceremony; reaching over the table with it, to
	the imminent jeopardy of many heads, and grappling the
	beefsteaks towards him.

	[Pestilence:] And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals,

	beasts saying, Come and see.  And I saw, and behold a white
	horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given

	second beast say, Come and see.  And there went out another
	horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon
	to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one
	another: and there was given unto him a great sword.

	[Famine:] And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the
	third beast say, Come and see.  And I beheld, and lo a black
	horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his
	hand.  And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say,
	A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley
	for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine.

	[Death:] And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the
	voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see.  And I looked, and
	behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death,

	Humanoids are all approximately the size of a human, and may
	be mistaken for one at a distance.  They are usually of a
	tribal nature, and will fiercely defend their lairs.  Usually
	hostile, they may even band together to raid and pillage
	human settlements.
	These strange creatures live mostly on the surface of the
	earth, gathering together in societies of various forms, but
	occasionally a stray will descend into the depths and commit
	mayhem among the dungeon residents who, naturally, often
	resent the intrusion of such beasts.  They are capable of
	using weapons and magic, and it is even rumored that the
	Wizard of Yendor is a member of this species.

	Ice devils are large semi-insectoid creatures, who are
	equally at home in the fires of Hell and the cold of Limbo,
	and who can cause the traveller to feel the latter with just
	a touch of their tail.
	Found mainly near the frozen wastes of the north, the Ice Mages
	are a mysterious group of individuals who are rumored to be 
	descendants of a once great northern civilization that fell into 
	chaos over a thousand years ago.  
	They wield the power of elemental cold, a conglomeration of elemental 
	air and water.  They are particularly effective fighting fire-based 
	creatures. Although they command of two of the four elements, Ice Mages 
	have difficulty affecting undead, who are immune to cold.

	 ... imps ... little creatures of two feet high that could

		[ The Charwoman's Shadow, by Lord Dunsany ]

	An 'imp' is an off-shoot or cutting.  Thus an 'ymp tree' was
	a grafted tree, or one grown from a cutting, not from seed.
	'Imp' properly means a small devil, an off-shoot of Satan,
	but the distinction between goblins or bogles and imps from
	hell is hard to make, and many in the Celtic countries as
	well as the English Puritans regarded all fairies as devils.
	The fairies of tradition often hover uneasily between the
	ghostly and the diabolic state.

	Now Issek of the Jug, whom Fafhrd chose to serve, was once
	of the most lowly and unsuccessful of the gods, godlets
	rather, in Lankhmar.  He had dwelt there for about thirteen
	years, during which time he had traveled only two squares up

	oblivion.  He is not to be confused with Issek the Armless,
	Issek of the Burnt Legs, Flayed Issek, or any other of the
	numerous and colorfully mutilated divinities of that name.
	Indeed, his unpopularity may have been due in part to the

	The shopkeeper of the lighting shop in the town level of the
	gnomish mines is a tribute to Izchak Miller, a founding member
	of the NetHack development team and a personal friend of a large
	number of us.  Izchak contributed greatly to the game, coding a
	large amount of the shopkeep logic (hence the nature of the tribute)
	as well as a good part of the alignment system, the prayer code and
	the rewrite of "hell" in the 3.1 release.  Izchak was a professor
	of Philosophy, who taught at many respected institutions, including
	MIT and Stanford, and who also worked, for a period of time, at
	Xerox PARC.  Izchak was the first "librarian" of the NetHack project,
	and was a founding member of the DevTeam, joining in 1986 while he
	was working at the University of Pennsylvania (hence our former
	mailing list address).  Until the 3.1.3 release, Izchak carefully
	kept all of the code synchronized and arbitrated disputes between
	members of the development teams.  Izchak Miller passed away at the
	age of 58, in the early morning hours of April 1, 1994 from
	complications due to cancer.  We then dedicated NetHack 3.2 in his

	In Asiatic folktale, jackal provides for the lion; he scares
	up game, which the lion kills and eats, and receives what is
	left as reward.  In stories from northern India he is
	sometimes termed "minister to the king," i.e. to the lion.
	From the legend that he does not kill his own food has arisen
	the legend of his cowardice.  Jackal's heart must never be

	the regions where the jackal abounds. ... In Hausa Negro

	victims which can be almost instantly fatal.
	The kabuto is the helmet worn by the samurai.  It was
	characterized by a prominent beaked front which jutted out over
	the brow to protect the wearer's face; a feature that gives
	rise to their modern Japanese name of 'shokaku tsuki kabuto'
	(battering-ram helmet).  Their main constructional element
	was an oval plate, the shokaku bo, slightly domed for the
	head with a narrow prolongation in front that curved forwards
	and downwards where it developed a pronounced central
	fold.  Two horizontal strips encircling the head were riveted
	to this frontal strip:  the lower one, the koshimaki (hip
	wrap), formed the lower edge of the helmet bowl; the other,
	the do maki (body wrap), was set at about the level of the
	temples.  Filling the gaps between these strips and the shokaku
	bo were small plates, sometimes triangular but more commonly
	rectangular in shape.  Because the front projected so
	far from the head, the triangular gap beneath was filled by
	a small plate, the shoshaku tei ita, whose rear edge bent
	downwards into a flange that rested against the forehead.

	Ector took both his sons to the church before which the

	commanded Kay:  "Put the sword back into the steel if you
	really think the throne is yours!"  But the sword glanced
	off the steel.  "Now it is your turn", Ector said facing
	Arthur.
	The young man lifted the sword and thrust with both arms; the
	blade whizzed through the air with a flash and drilled the
	metal as if it were mere butter.  Ector and Kay dropped to
	their knees before Arthur.
	"Why, father and brother, do you bow before me?", Arthur asked
	with wonder in his voice.
	"Because now I know for sure that you are the king, not only

	The race of kobolds are reputed to be an artificial creation
	of a master wizard (demi-god?).  They are about 3' tall with
	a vaguely dog-like face.  They bear a violent dislike of the
	Elven race, and will go out of their way to cause trouble
	for Elves at any time.
	The Kops are a brilliant concept.  To take a gaggle of inept
	policemen and display them over and over again in a series of
	riotously funny physical punishments plays equally well to the
	peanut gallery and the expensive box seats.  People hate cops.
	Even people who have never had anything to do with cops hate
	them.  Of course, we count on them to keep order and to protect
	us when we need protecting, and we love them on television shows
	in which they have nerves of steel and hearts of gold, but in
	the abstract, as a nation, collectively we hate them.  They are
	too much like high school principals.  We're very happy to see
	their pants fall down, and they look good to us with pie on
	their faces.  The Keystone Kops turn up--and they get punished
	for it, as they crash into each other, fall down, and suffer
	indignity after indignity.  Here is pure movie satisfaction.

	The Kops are very skillfully presented.  The comic originality
	and timing in one of their chase scenes requires imagination
	to think up, talent to execute, understanding of the medium,
	and, of course, raw courage to perform.  The Kops are madmen
	presented as incompetents, and they're madmen rushing around
	in modern machines.  What's more, the machines they were operating
	in their routines were newly invented and not yet experienced
	by the average moviegoer.  (In the early days of automobiles,
	it was reported that there were only two cars registered in all
	of Kansas City, and they ran into each other.  There is both

	lacking iris or pupil, and they glowed from within.

	The room was silent as she scrabbled in her box of pieces and,
	from the very bottom, produced a couple that she set down on

	The Irish Leprechaun is the Faeries' shoemaker and is known
	under various names in different parts of Ireland:
	Cluricaune in Cork, Lurican in Kerry, Lurikeen in Kildare
	and Lurigadaun in Tipperary.  Although he works for the
	Faeries, the Leprechaun is not of the same species.  He is
	small, has dark skin and wears strange clothes.  His nature
	has something of the manic-depressive about it:  first he
	is quite happy, whistling merrily as he nails a sole on to a
	shoe; a few minutes later, he is sullen and morose, drunk
	on his home-made heather ale.  The Leprechaun's two great
	loves are tobacco and whiskey, and he is a first-rate con-man,
	impossible to out-fox.  No one, no matter how clever, has ever
	managed to cheat him out of his hidden pot of gold or his
	magic shilling.  At the last minute he always thinks of some
	way to divert his captor's attention and vanishes in the
	twinkling of an eye.

	The Lethe is a river, slow, dark and deep, which flows from
	the mortal world to the forbidden lands of Gehennom.  It is
	said that a single sip of its sparkling waters is enough to
	wash a man's memories away, never to return.
	But on its heels ere the sunset faded, there came a second
	apparition, striding with incredible strides and halting when
	it loomed almost upon me in the red twilight-the monstrous mummy
	of some ancient king still crowned with untarnished gold but
	turning to my gaze a visage that more than time or the worm had
	wasted. Broken swathings flapped about the skeleton legs, and
	above the crown that was set with sapphires and orange rubies, a
	black something swayed and nodded horribly; but, for an instant,
	I did not dream what it was.  Then, in its middle, two oblique
	and scarlet eyes opened and glowed like hellish coals, and two
	ophidian fangs glittered in an ape-like mouth.  A squat, furless,
	shapeless head on a neck of disproportionate extent leaned
	unspeakably down and whispered in the mummy's ear. Then, with
	one stride, the titanic lich took half the distance between us,
	and from out the folds of the tattered sere-cloth a gaunt arm
	arose, and fleshless, taloned fingers laden with glowering gems,
	reached out and fumbled for my throat . . .

	Lugh, or Lug, was the sun god of the Irish Celts.  One of his
	weapons was a rod-sling which worshippers sometimes saw in
	the sky as a rainbow.  As a tribal god, he was particularly
	skilled in the use of his massive, invincible spear, which
	fought on its own accord.  One of his epithets is _lamfhada_
	(of the long arm).  He was a young and apparently more
	attractive deity than Dagda, the father of the gods.  Being
	able to shapeshift, his name translates as lynx.

	The people were empowered to "assemble with javelins,
	halberds, pikes, arquebuses and clubs, to hunt and pursue the
	said were-wolf in all places where they could find it, and to
	take, burn, and kill it, without incurring any fine or other
	penalty."  The hunt seems to have been successful, if we may
	judge from the fact that the same tribunal in the following
	year condemned to be burned a man named Giles Garnier, who
	ran on all fours in the forest and fields and devoured little

	One day, an army general invited the Buddhist monk I-Hsiu

	I-Hsiu was unable to convince the soldiers that he was

	and changed to a very formal solemn ceremonial robe for
	the dinner.  And as he returned to the military base, the
	soldiers observed that he was such a great Buddhist monk,
	let him in with honour.

	At the dinner, I-Hsiu sat in front of the table full of

	A female creature from Roman and Greek mythology, the nymph
	occupied rivers, forests, ponds, etc.  A nymph's beauty is
	beyond words:  an ever-young woman with sleek figure and
	long, thick hair, radiant skin and perfect teeth, full lips
	and gentle eyes.  A nymph's scent is delightful, and her
	long robe glows, hemmed with golden threads and embroidered
	with rainbow hues of unearthly magnificence.  A nymph's
	demeanour is graceful and charming, her mind quick and witty.

	pain.  There was fear.  But his head was in the nymph's lap
	and her musk was about him, her voice weaving the dream.  He
	knew then that she had been sent to tell him of something
	dreadful that was to happen to him later.  Her song was a
	warning.  But she had brought him a new kind of joy, one that
	made him see everything differently.  The boy, who was to
	become a hero, suddenly knew then what most heroes learn
	later -- and some too late -- that joy blots suffering and
	that the road to nymphs is beset by monsters."

	Also called Sigtyr (god of Victory), Val-father (father of
	the slain), One-Eyed, Hanga-god (god of the hanged), Farma-
	god (god of cargoes), Hapta-god (god of prisoners), and
	Othin.  He is the prime god of the Norsemen:  god of war and
	victory, wisdom and prophecy, poetry, the dead, air and wind,
	hospitality, and magic.
	As the god of war and victory, Odin is ruler of the Valkyries,
	warrior-maidens who lived in the halls of Valhalla in Asgard,
	the hall of dead heroes where he held his court.
	These chosen ones will defend the realm of the gods against
	the Frost Giants on the final day of reckoning, Ragnarok.
	As god of the wind, Odin rides through the air on his eight-
	footed horse, Sleipnir, wielding Gungner, his spear, normally
	accompanied by his ravens, Hugin and Munin, who he would also
	use as his spies.
	As a god of hospitality, he enjoys visiting the earth in
	disguise to see how people were behaving and to see how they
	would treat him, not knowing who he was.
	Odin is usually represented as a one-eyed wise old man with a
	long white beard and a wide-brimmed hat (he gave one of his
	eyes to Mimir, the guardian of the well of wisdom in Hel, in
	exchange for a draught of knowledge).
	Anyone who has met a gluttonous, nude, angry ogre, will not
	easily forget this encounter -- if he survives it at all.
	Both male and female ogres can easily grow as tall as three
	metres.  Build and facial expressions would remind one of a
	Neanderthal.  Its small, pointy, keen teeth are striking.
	Since ogres avoid direct sunlight, their ragged, unfurry
	skin is as white as a sheet.  They enjoy coating their body
	with lard and usually wear nothing but a loin-cloth.  An elf
	would smell its rancid stench at ten metres distance.
	Ogres are solitary creatures:  very rarely one may encounter
	a female with two or three young.  They are the only real
	carnivores among the humanoids, and its favourite meal is --
	not surprisingly -- human flesh.  They sometimes ally with
	orcs or goblins, but only when they anticipate a good meaty
	meal.

	"Lonely men are we, Rangers of the wild, hunters -- but hunters
	ever of the servants of the Enemy; for they are found in many
	places, not in Mordor only.
	If Gondor, Boromir, has been a stalwart tower, we have played
	another part.  Many evil things there are that your strong walls
	and bright swords do not stay.  You know little of the lands
	beyond your bounds.  Peace and freedom, do you say?  The North
	would have known them little but for us.  Fear would have
	destroyed them.  But when dark things come from the houseless
	hills, or creep from sunless woods, they fly from us.  What

	A variant of the pike, the ranseur has a thin, double-edged 
	primary blade. Secondary blades are backward-hooking projections 
	set well below the large central blade, forming a crown-shape. 
	The spearing function of the weapon is apparent, and the 
	deflection includes the trapping of opponent weapons in the space 
	below the main blade, where a twist of the shaft would apply 
	pressure from it or the secondary projections to either break the 
	caught weapon or disarm its wielder. Additionally, the side 
	projections provide both a means of holding an opponent at long 
	range or of pulling mounted opponents off their steed.
	Rats are long-tailed rodents.  They are aggressive,
	omnivorous, and adaptable, often carrying diseases.

	"The rat," said O'Brien, still addressing his invisible
	audience, "although a rodent, is carnivorous.  You are aware
	of that.  You will have heard of the things that happen in
	the poor quarters of this town.  In some streets a woman dare
	not leave her baby alone in the house, even for five minutes.
	The rats are certain to attack it.  Within quite a small time
	they will strip it to the bones.  They also attack sick or
	dying people.  They show astonishing intelligence in knowing
	when a human being is helpless."

	Bilbo saw that the moment had come when he must do something.
	He could not get up at the brutes and he had nothing to shoot
	with; but looking about he saw that in this place there were
	many stones lying in what appeared to be a now dry little
	watercourse.  Bilbo was a pretty fair shot with a stone, and
	it did not take him long to find a nice smooth egg-shaped one
	that fitted his hand cosily.  As a boy he used to practise
	throwing stones at things, until rabbits and squirrels, and
	even birds, got out of his way as quick as lightning if they
	saw him stoop; and even grownup he had still spent a deal of
	his time at quoits, dart-throwing, shooting at the wand,
	bowls, ninepins and other quiet games of the aiming and
	throwing sort - indeed he could do lots of things, besides
	blowing smoke-rings, asking riddles and cooking, that I
	haven't time to tell you about.  There is no time now.  While
	he was picking up stones, the spider had reached Bombur, and
	soon he would have been dead.  At that moment Bilbo threw.
	The stone struck the spider plunk on the head, and it dropped
	senseless off the tree, flop to the ground, with all its legs
	curled up.

	Ildefonse left the terrace and almost immediately sounds

	Ildefonse presently returned to the terrace, followed by
	Osherl and a second sandestin using the guise of a gaunt blue

	Ildefonse spoke in scathing tones:  "Behold these two
	creatures!  They can roam the chronoplex as easily as you
	or I can walk around the table; yet neither has the wit to
	announce his presence upon arrival.  I found Osherl asleep

	"In this guise, I find it more convenient to stand."

	"Then why not alter to human form and join us in comfort at
	the table?"

	"That is a good idea."  Sarsem became a naked young epicene
	in an integument of lavender scales with puffs of purple hair
	like pom-poms growing down his back.  He seated himself at

	The name _Sasquatch_ doesn't really become important in Canada
	until the 1930s, when it appeared in the works of J. W. Burns,
	a British Columbian writer who used a great deal of Indian
	lore in his stories.  Burn's Sasquatch was a giant Indian who
	lived in the wilderness.  He was hairy only in the sense that
	he had long hair on his head, and while this Sasquatch lived a
	wild and primitive life, he was fully human.
	Burns's character proved to be quite popular.  There was a
	Sasquatch Inn near the town of Harrison, British Columbia, and
	Harrison even had a local celebration called "Sasquatch Days."
	The celebration which had been dormant for years was revived
	as part of British Columbia's centennial, and one of the
	events was to be a Sasquatch hunt.  The hunt never took place,
	perhaps it was never supposed to, but the publicity about it
	did bring out a number of people who said they had encountered
	a Sasquatch -- not Burns's giant Indian, but the hairy apelike
	creature that we have all come to know.

	weary foot was barely able to follow the other.  Milo suddenly
	realized that with all his effort he was no closer to the top
	than when he began, and not a great deal further from the
	bottom.  But he struggled on for a while longer, until at last,
	completely exhausted, he collapsed onto one of the steps.
	"I should have known it," he mumbled, resting his tired legs
	and filling his lungs with air.  "This is just like the line
	that goes on forever, and I'll never get there."

	Then at last he began to wonder why the lion was standing so
	still - for it hadn't moved one inch since he first set eyes
	on it.  Edmund now ventured a little nearer, still keeping in
	the shadow of the arch as much as he could.  He now saw from
	the way the lion was standing that it couldn't have been
	looking at him at all.  ("But supposing it turns its head?"
	thought Edmund.)  In fact it was staring at something else -
	namely a little dwarf who stood with his back to it about
	four feet away.  "Aha!" thought Edmund.  "When it springs at
	the dwarf then will be my chance to escape."  But still the
	lion never moved, nor did the dwarf.  And now at last Edmund
	remembered what the others had said about the White Witch
	turning people into stone.  Perhaps this was only a stone
	lion.  And as soon as he had thought of that he noticed that
	the lion's back and the top of its head were covered with

	There was the usual dim grey light of the forest-day about

	him, and his sword-blade was stained black.  Somehow the
	killing of the giant spider, all alone and by himself in the
	dark without the help of the wizard or the dwarves or of
	anyone else, made a great difference to Mr. Baggins.  He felt
	a different person, and much fiercer and bolder in spite of

	it back into its sheath.

	There were sounds in the distance, incongruent with the 
	sounds of even this nameless, timeless sea: thin sounds, 
	agonized and terrible, for all that they remained 
	remote - yet the ship followed them, as if drawn by
	them; they grew louder-pain and despair were there, but 
	terror was predominant.
	Elric had heard such sounds echoing from his cousin Yyrkoon's
	sardonically named 'Pleasure Chambers' in the days before he 
	had fled the responsibilities of ruling all that remained of 
	the old Melnibonean Empire.  These were the voices of men 
	whose very souls were under siege; men to whom death meant 
	not mere extinction, but a continuation of existence, forever 
	in thrall to some cruel and supernatural master.  He had heard 
	men cry so when his salvation and his nemesis, his great black
	battle-blade Stormbringer, drank their souls.
		[ The Lands Beyond the World, by Michael Moorcock ]

	Without thinking, he drew Stormbringer from its sheath.
	The Black Sword began to howl and the familiar black radiance
	spilled from it.  The runes carved into its blade pulsed a vivid
	scarlet which slowly turned to a deep purple and then to black
	once more.
	The creatures were wading through the water on their
	stiltlike legs and paused when they saw the sword, glancing at
	one another.  And they were not the only ones unnerved by the
	sight, for Duke Avan and his men paled too.
	'Gods!' yelled Duke Avan.  'I know not which I prefer
	the look of - those who attack us or that which defends us!'
	'Stay well away from that sword,' Smiorgan warned.
	'It has the habit of killing more than its master chooses.'"

	The Pan Tangian strove to imitate Elric's irony.  
	'But you will note, Sir Demon, that we outnumber you.  
	Considerably.'
	Softly the albino spoke: 'I've noticed that fact, but I'm not 
	disturbed by it,' and he had drawn the black blade even as he
	finished speaking, for they had come at him with a rush.
	The Pan Tangian was the first to die, sliced through the
	side, his vertebrae sheared, and Stormbringer, having taken its
	first soul, began to sing.
	A Chalalite died next, leaping with stabbing javelin
	poised, on the point of the runesword, and Stormbringer murmured
	with pleasure.
	But it was not until it had sliced the head clean off a
	Filkharian pike-master that the sword began to croon and come

	Ladon in western Arcadia, and no longer being able to escape,
	she asked to the nymphs of the river to change her form.  And
	the nymphs, listening to her prayers, turned her into marsh

	you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie
	on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus
	V, inhaling the heady sea vapors; you can sleep under it
	beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert world of
	Kakrafoon; use it to sail a miniraft down down the slow heavy
	River Moth; wet it for use in hand-to-hand combat; wrap it

	of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (a mind-bogglingly
	stupid animal, it assumes that if you can't see it, it can't

	be a powerful talisman.  It was said that the unicorn had
	simply to dip the tip of its horn in a muddy pool for the water

	was a protection against all sickness, and that if the horn was
	ground to a powder it would act as an antidote to all poisons.

	Although only the size of a small horse, the unicorn is a very

	thrust from its horn.  Its fleetness of foot also makes this
	solitary creature difficult to capture.  However, it can be

	the leverage which the pole gives the wielder will enable him 
	to cleave through armor. The voulge has no provision to keep 
	the enemy at a distance in its basic model, but with the top 
	front or back edge is ground down so as to provide a pointed, 
	dagger-like tip, the weapon assumes a more complete form.
	The vrock is one of the weaker forms of demon.  It resembles
	a cross between a human being and a vulture and does physical
	damage by biting and by using the claws on both its arms and
	feet.
	The samurai warrior traditionally wears two swords; the
	wakizashi is the shorter of the two.  See also katana.
 		:walking drives: n. An occasional failure mode of magnetic-disk
 		drives back in the days when they were huge, clunky {washing
 		machine}s.  Those old {dinosaur} parts carried terrific angular
 		momentum;the combination of a misaligned spindle or worn bearings
 		and stick-slip interactions with the floor could cause them to
 		`walk' across a room, lurching alternate corners forward a couple
 		of millimeters at a time.  There is a legend about a drive that
 		walked over to the only door to the computer room and jammed it
 		shut; the staff had to cut a hole in the wall in order to get at
 		it!  Walking could also be induced by certain patterns of drive
 		access(a fast seek across the whole width of the disk,followed by
 		a slow seek in the other direction).  Some bands of old-time
 		hackers figured out how to induce disk-accessing patterns that
 		would do this to particular drive models and held disk-drive races.
 		[ The Jargon File, version 3.0.0 ]
	'Saruman!' he cried, and his voice grew in power and authority.
	'Behold, I am not Gandalf the Grey, whom you betrayed.  I am
	Gandalf the White, who has returned from death.  You have no
	colour now, and I cast you from the order and from the Council.'
	He raised his hand, and spoke slowly in a clear cold voice.
	'Saruman, your staff is broken.'  There was a crack, and the
	staff split asunder in Saruman's hand, and the head of it
	fell down at Gandalf's feet.  'Go!' said Gandalf.  With a cry
	Saruman fell back and crawled away.
		[ The Two Towers, by J.R.R. Tolkien ]
	Suddenly Aragorn leapt to his feet.  "How the wind howls!"
	he cried.  "It is howling with wolf-voices.  The Wargs have
	come west of the Mountains!"
	"Need we wait until morning then?" said Gandalf.  "It is as I
	said.  The hunt is up!  Even if we live to see the dawn, who
	now will wish to journey south by night with the wild wolves
	on his trail?"
	"How far is Moria?" asked Boromir.
	"There was a door south-west of Caradhras, some fifteen miles
	as the crow flies, and maybe twenty as the wolf runs,"
	answered Gandalf grimly.
	"Then let us start as soon as it is light tomorrow, if we can,"
	said Boromir.  "The wolf that one hears is worse than the orc
	that one fears."
	"True!" said Aragorn, loosening his sword in its sheath.  "But
	where the warg howls, there also the orc prowls."
		[ The Fellowship of the Ring, by J.R.R. Tolkien ]
	They had come together at the ford of the Trident while the
	battle crashed around them, Robert with his warhammer and his
	great antlered helm, the Targaryen prince armored all in
	black.  On his breastplate was the three-headed dragon of his
	House, wrought all in rubies that flashed like fire in the
	sunlight.  The waters of the Trident ran red around the
	hooves of their destriers as they circled and clashed, again
	and again, until at last a crushing blow from Robert's hammer
	stove in the dragon and the chest behind it.  When Ned had
	finally come on the scene, Rhaegar lay dead in the stream,
	while men of both armies scrambled in the swirling waters for
	rubies knocked free of his armor.
		[ A Game of Thrones, by George R.R. Martin ]
	Day after day, day after day,
	We stuck, nor breath nor motion;
	As idle as a painted ship
	Upon a painted ocean.

	Water, water, everywhere,
	And all the boards did shrink;
	Water, water, everywhere
	Nor any drop to drink.
		[ The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, by Samuel Taylor
		  Coleridge ]
	Oh what a tangled web we weave,
	When first we practise to deceive!
		[ Marmion, by Sir Walter Scott ]
	When he came to himself again, for a moment he could recall
	nothing except a sense of dread.  Then suddenly he knew that
	he was imprisoned, caught hopelessly; he was in a barrow.  A
	Barrow-wight had taken him, and he was probably already under
	the dreadful spells of the Barrow-wights about which whispered
	tales spoke.  He dared not move, but lay as he found himself:
	flat on his back upon a cold stone with his hands on his
	breast.
		[ The Fellowship of the Ring, by J.R.R. Tolkien ]
	Ebenezum walked before me along the closest thing we could
	find to a path in these overgrown woods.  Every few paces he
	would pause, so that I, burdened with a pack stuffed with
	arcane and heavy paraphernalia, could catch up with his
	wizardly strides.  He, as usual, carried nothing, preferring,
	as he often said, to keep his hands free for quick conjuring
	and his mind free for the thoughts of a mage.
		[ A Dealing with Demons, by Craig Shaw Gardner ]
	No one knows how old this mighty wizard is, or from whence he
	came.  It is known that, having lived a span far greater than
	any normal man's, he grew weary of lesser mortals; and so,
	spurning all human company, he forsook the dwellings of men
	and went to live in the depths of the Earth.  He took with
	him a dreadful artifact, the Book of the Dead, which is said
	to hold great power indeed.  Many have sought to find the
	wizard and his treasure, but none have found him and lived to
	tell the tale.  Woe be to the incautious adventurer who
	disturbs this mighty sorcerer!
	The ancestors of the modern day domestic dog, wolves are
	powerful muscular animals with bushy tails.  Intelligent,
	social animals, wolves live in family groups or packs made
	up of multiple family units.  These packs cooperate in hunting
	down prey.
	The Usenet Oracle requires an answer to this question!

	> How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could
	> chuck wood?

	"Oh, heck!  I'll handle *this* one!"  The Oracle spun the terminal
	back toward himself, unlocked the ZOT-guard lock, and slid the
	glass guard away from the ZOT key.  "Ummmm....could you turn around
	for a minute?  ZOTs are too graphic for the uninitiated.  Even *I*
	get a little squeamish sometimes..."  The neophyte turned around,
	and heard the Oracle slam his finger on a computer key, followed
	by a loud ZZZZOTTTTT and the smell of ozone.
		[ Excerpted from Internet Oracularity 576.6 ]
	[The crysknife] is manufactured in two forms from teeth taken
	from dead sandworms.  The two forms are "fixed" and "unfixed".
	An unfixed knife requires proximity to a human body's
	electrical field to prevent disintegration.  Fixed knives
	are treated for storage.  All are about 20 centimeters long.
		[ Dune, by Frank Herbert ]
	Immediately, though everything else remained as before, dim
	and dark, the shapes became terribly clear.  He was able to
	see beneath their black wrappings.  There were five tall
	figures:  two standing on the lip of the dell, three advancing.
	In their white faces burned keen and merciless eyes; under
	their mantles were long grey robes; upon their grey hairs
	were helms of silver; in their haggard hands were swords of
	steel.  Their eyes fell on him and pierced him, as they
	rushed towards him.  Desperate, he drew his own sword, and
	it seemed to him that it flickered red, as if it was a
	firebrand.  Two of the figures halted.  The third was taller
	than the others:  his hair was long and gleaming and on his
	helm was a crown.  In one hand he held a long sword, and in
	the other a knife; both the knife and the hand that held it
	glowed with a pale light.  He sprang forward and bore down
	on Frodo.
		[ The Fellowship of the Ring, by J.R.R. Tolkien ]
	The Wumpus, by the way, is not bothered by the hazards since
	he has sucker feet and is too big for a bat to lift.  If you
	try to shoot him and miss, there's also a chance that he'll
	up and move himself into another cave, though by nature the
	Wumpus is a sedentary creature.
		[ wump(6) -- "Hunt the Wumpus" ]
	They sent their friend the mosquito [xan] ahead of them to
	find out what lay ahead.  "Since you are the one who sucks
	the blood of men walking along paths," they told the mosquito,
	"go and sting the men of Xibalba."  The mosquito flew
	down the dark road to the Underworld.  Entering the house of
	the Lords of Death, he stung the first person that he saw...

	The mosquito stung this man as well, and when he yelled, the
	man next to him asked, "Gathered Blood, what's wrong?"  So
	he flew along the row stinging all the seated men until he
	knew the names of all twelve.
			[ Popul Vuh, as translated by Ralph Nelson ]
	A distant cousin of the earth elemental, the xorn has the
	ability to shift the cells of its body around in such a way
	that it becomes porous to inert material.  This gives it the
	ability to pass through any obstacle that might be between it
	and its next meal.
	The arrow of choice of the samurai, ya are made of very
	straight bamboo, and are tipped with hardened steel.
	Yeenoghu, the demon lord of gnolls, still exists although
	all his followers have been wiped off the face of the earth.
	He casts magic projectiles at those close to him, and a mere
	gaze into his piercing eyes may hopelessly confuse the
	battle-weary adventurer.
	The Abominable Snowman, or yeti, is one of the truly great
	unknown animals of the twentieth century.  It is a large hairy
	biped that lives in the Himalayan region of Asia ... The story
	of the Abominable Snowman is filled with mysteries great and
	small, and one of the most difficult of all is how it got that
	awful name.  The creature is neither particularly abominable,
	nor does it necessarily live in the snows.  _Yeti_ is a Tibetan
	word which may apply either to a real, but unknown animal of
	the Himalayas, or to a mountain spirit or demon -- no one is
	quite sure which.  And after nearly half a century in which
	Westerners have trampled around looking for the yeti, and
	asking all sorts of questions, the original native traditions
	concerning the creature have become even more muddled and
	confused.
		[ The Encyclopedia of Monsters, by Daniel Cohen ]
	Japanese leather archery gloves.  Gloves made for use while
	practicing had thumbs reinforced with horn.  Those worn into
	battle had thumbs reinforced with a double layer of leather.
	The samurai is highly trained with a special type of bow,
	the yumi.  Like the ya, the yumi is made of bamboo.  With
	the yumi-ya, the bow and arrow, the samurai is an extremely
	accurate and deadly warrior.
	The zombi... is a soulless human corpse, still dead, but
	taken from the grave and endowed by sorcery with a
	mechanical semblance of life, -- it is a dead body which is
	made to walk and act and move as if it were alive.
		[ W. B. Seabrook ]
	The zruty are wild and gigantic beings, living in the
	wildernesses of the Tatra mountains.

        Welcome to NetHack!                ( description of version 3.4 )

        NetHack is a Dungeons and Dragons like game where you (the adventurer)
descend into the depths of the dungeon in search of the Amulet of Yendor,
reputed to be hidden somewhere below the twentieth level.  You begin your
adventure with a pet that can help you in many ways, and can be trained
to do all sorts of things.  On the way you will find useful (or useless)
items, quite possibly with magic properties, and assorted monsters.  You can
attack a monster by trying to move onto the space a monster is on (but often
it is much wiser to leave it alone).

        Unlike most adventure games, which give you a verbal description of
your location, NetHack gives you a visual image of the dungeon level you are
on.

        NetHack uses the following symbols:

        - and |  The walls of a room, possibly also open doors or a grave.
        .        The floor of a room or a doorway.
        #        A corridor, or iron bars, or a tree, or possibly a kitchen
                 sink (if your dungeon has sinks), or a drawbridge.
        >        Stairs down: a way to the next level.
        <        Stairs up: a way to the previous level.
        @        You (usually), or another human.
        )        A weapon of some sort.
        [        A suit or piece of armor.
        %        Something edible (not necessarily healthy).
        /        A wand.
        =        A ring.
        ?        A scroll.
        !        A potion.
        (        Some other useful object (pick-axe, key, lamp...)
        $        A pile of gold.
        *        A gem or rock (possibly valuable, possibly worthless).
        +        A closed door, or a spell book containing a spell
                 you can learn.
        ^        A trap (once you detect it).
        "        An amulet, or a spider web.
        0        An iron ball.
        _        An altar, or an iron chain.
        {        A fountain.
        }        A pool of water or moat or a pool of lava.
        \        An opulent throne.
        `        A boulder or statue.
        A to Z, a to z, and several others:  Monsters.
        I        Invisible or unseen monster's last known location

                 You can find out what a symbol represents by typing
                 '/' and following the directions to move the cursor
                 to the symbol in question.  For instance, a 'd' may
                 turn out to be a dog.


y k u   7 8 9   Move commands:
 \|/     \|/            yuhjklbn: go one step in specified direction
h-.-l   4-.-6           YUHJKLBN: go in specified direction until you
 /|\     /|\                        hit a wall or run into something
b j n   1 2 3           g<dir>:   run in direction <dir> until something
      numberpad                     interesting is seen
                        G<dir>,   same, except a branching corridor isn't

                                    case means the Control key, not a caret)

                Depending on the platform, Shift number (on the numberpad),
                Meta number, or Alt number will invoke the YUHJKLBN commands.
                Control <dir> may or may not work when number_pad is enabled,
                depending on the platform's capabilities.

Commands:
        NetHack knows the following commands:
        ?       Help menu.
        `       Main Menu.
        /       Tell what a symbol represents.  You may choose to specify
                a location or give a symbol argument.
        &       Tell what a command does.
        <       Go up a staircase (if you are standing on it).
        >       Go down a staircase (if you are standing on it).
        .       Rest, do nothing for one turn.
        _       Travel via a shortest-path algorithm to a point on the map 
        a       Apply (use) a tool (pick-axe, key, lamp...)
        A       Remove all armor.
        ^A      Redo the previous command

        ^B      Steal
        c       Close a door.
        C       Call (name) an individual monster.
        d       Drop something.  d7a:  drop seven items of object a.
        D       Drop multiple items.  This command is implemented in two
                different ways.  One way is:
                "D" displays a list of all of your items, from which you can
                pick and choose what to drop.  A "+" next to an item means
                that it will be dropped, a "-" means that it will not be
                dropped.  Toggle an item to be selected/deselected by typing
                the letter adjacent to its description.  Select all items
                with "+", deselect all items with "=".  The <SPACEBAR> moves
                you from one page of the listing to the next.
                The other way is:
                "D" will ask the question "What kinds of things do you want
                to drop? [!%= au]".  You should type zero or more object
                symbols possibly followed by 'a' and/or 'u'.
                Da - drop all objects, without asking for confirmation.
                Du - drop only unpaid objects (when in a shop).
                D%u - drop only unpaid food.
        ^D      Kick (for doors, usually).
        f       Fire ammunition from quiver.
        F       Followed by direction, fight a monster (even if you don't
                sense it).
        e       Eat food. Vampires cannot eat as such. However, they can
                gain nutrition by draining blood from fresh corpses using
                this command.
        E       Engrave a message on the floor.
                E- - write in the dust with your fingers.
        f       Fire ammunition from quiver.
        i       Display your inventory.
        I       Display selected parts of your inventory, as in
                I* - list all gems in inventory.
                Iu - list all unpaid items.
                Ix - list all used up items that are on your shopping bill.
                I$ - count your money.
	n#      repeat next command             
	N       name or classify an item
        o       Open a door.
        O       Review current options and possibly change them.
                A menu displaying the option settings will be displayed
                and most can be changed by simply selecting their entry.
                Options are usually set before the game with a NETHACKOPTIONS
                environment variable, or via a config file (defaults.nh,
                Slash'EM Defaults, nethack.cnf, .nethackrc, etc.), not with 
                the 'O' command.

        #       Introduces one of the "extended" commands.  To get a list of
                the commands you can use with "#" type "#?".  The extended
                commands you can use depends upon what options the game was
                compiled with, along with your class and what type of monster
                you most closely resemble at a given moment.  If your keyboard
                has a meta key (which, when pressed in combination with another
                key, modifies it by setting the 'meta' (8th, or 'high') bit),
                these extended commands can be invoked by meta-ing the first
                letter of the command.  An alt key may have a similar effect.

        If the "number_pad" option is on, some additional letter commands
        are available:

        h       displays the help menu, like '?'
        j       Jump to another location.
        k       Kick (for doors, usually).
        K       List vanquished monsters (whether by you or not).
        l       Loot a box on the floor.
        n       followed by number of times to repeat the next command
        N       Name an object or type of object.
        u       Untrap a trapped object or door.

        You can put a number before a command to repeat it that many times,
        as in "40." or "20s.".  If you have the number_pad option set, you
        must type 'n' to prefix the count, as in "n40." or "n20s".


        Some information is displayed on the bottom line or perhaps in a
        box, depending on the platform you are using.  You see your
        attributes, your alignment, what dungeon level you are on, how many
        hit points you have now (and will have when fully recovered), what
        your armor class is (the lower the better), your experience level,
        and the state of your stomach.  Optionally, you may or may not see
        other information such as spell points, how much gold you have, etc.

        Have Fun, and Happy Hacking!

Behold, mortal, the origins of SLASH'EM...

Jay Fenlason wrote the original Hack with help from Kenny Woodland,
Mike Thome, and Jon Payne.

Andries Brouwer did a major re-write, transforming Hack into a very different
game, and published (at least) three versions (1.0.1, 1.0.2, and 1.0.3) for
UNIX(tm) machines to the Usenet.

Don G. Kneller ported Hack 1.0.3 to Microsoft(tm) C and MS-DOS(tm), producing
PC HACK 1.01e, added support for DEC Rainbow graphics in version 1.03g, and
went on to produce at least four more versions (3.0, 3.2, 3.51, and 3.6).

R. Black ported PC HACK 3.51 to Lattice(tm) C and the Atari 520/1040ST,
producing ST Hack 1.03.

Mike Stephenson merged these various versions back together, incorporating
many of the added features, and produced NetHack version 1.4.  He then
coordinated a cast of thousands in enhancing and debugging NetHack 1.4 and
released NetHack versions 2.2 and 2.3.
 
Later, Mike coordinated a major rewrite of the game, heading a team which
included Ken Arromdee, Jean-Christophe Collet, Steve Creps, Eric Hendrickson,
Izchak Miller, Eric S. Raymond, John Rupley, Mike Threepoint, and Janet Walz,
to produce NetHack 3.0c.  The same group subsequently released ten patch-
level revisions and updates of 3.0.

NetHack 3.0 was ported to the Atari by Eric R. Smith, to OS/2 by Timo
Hakulinen, and to VMS by David Gentzel.  The three of them and Kevin Darcy
later joined the main development team to produce subsequent revisions of
3.0.

Olaf Seibert ported NetHack 2.3 and 3.0 to the Amiga.  Norm Meluch, Stephen
Spackman and Pierre Martineau designed overlay code for PC NetHack 3.0.
Johnny Lee ported NetHack 3.0 to the Macintosh.  Along with various other
Dungeoneers, they continued to enhance the PC, Macintosh, and Amiga ports
through the later revisions of 3.0.

A scant one month before the next major version  release  of Nethack,  two  
adventurous souls undertook their own modification to the sacred Nethack
formula. Tom Proudfoot and  Yuval  released Nethack++,   which  was rapidly
renamed Nethack--,  containeing new monsters,  items and other miscellaneous
modifications.
 
Headed by Mike Stephenson and coordinated by Izchak Miller and Janet Walz,
the development team which now included Ken Arromdee, David Cohrs,
Jean-Christophe Collet, Kevin Darcy, Matt Day, Timo Hakulinen, Steve Linhart,
Dean Luick, Pat Rankin, Eric Raymond, and Eric Smith undertook a radical
revision of 3.0.  They re-structured the game's design, and re-wrote major
parts of the code.  They added multiple dungeons, a new display, special
individual character quests, a new endgame and many other new features, and
produced NetHack 3.1.

Ken Lorber, Gregg Wonderly and Greg Olson, with help from Richard Addison,
Mike Passaretti, and Olaf Seibert, developed NetHack 3.1 for the Amiga.

Norm Meluch and Kevin Smolkowski, with help from Carl Schelin, Stephen
Spackman, Steve VanDevender, and Paul Winner, ported NetHack 3.1 to the PC.

Jon Watte and Hao-yang Wang, with help from Ross Brown, Mike Engber, David
Hairston, Michael Hamel, Jonathan Handler, Johnny Lee, Tim Lennan, Rob Menke,
and Andy Swanson developed NetHack 3.1 for the Macintosh, porting it for
MPW.  Building on their development, Barton House added a Think C port.  

Timo Hakulinen ported NetHack 3.1 to OS/2.  Eric Smith ported NetHack 3.1
to the Atari.  Pat Rankin, with help from Joshua Delahunty, is responsible
for the VMS version of NetHack 3.1.  Michael Allison ported NetHack 3.1 to
Windows NT.

Dean Luick, with help from David Cohrs, developed NetHack 3.1 for X11.
Warwick Allison added in the "tiled" version of the game and generated most
of the individual tiles for NetHack 3.2.

Time passed,  and Nethack-- was ported to 3.11 by Chris.

Stephen White then released his own  modification  known  as Nethack  Plus,
which  contained  new  character classes.  Unbeknownst to the world at large,
Tom Proudfoot  took  this  source and combined it with his Nethack--.
Stephen White went on to add weapon skills,  which were eventually integrated
into  the  next version of Nethack,  and other features.

In February 1996,  Tom Proudfoot released SLASH V1.  Including part of
Stephen White's Nethack Plus and his  own  Nethack--, leaving  unmentioned
his own slew of further modifications,  this is perhaps the best known of
the Nethack modifications.  Six versions of this,  ending with SLASH V6,
are known to exist.

The 3.2 development team, comprised of: Michael Allison; Ken Arromdee; David
Cohrs; Jessie Collet; Steve Creps; Kevin Darcy; Timo Hakulinen; Steve
Linhart; Dean Luick; Pat Rankin; Eric Smith; Mike Stephenson; Janet Walz; and
Paul Winner, released version 3.2 in April of 1996.

Version 3.2 marks the tenth anniversary of the formation of the development
team.  In a testament to their dedication to the game, all thirteen members
of the original development team remained on the team at the start of work
on the current release.  During the interval between the release of 3.1.3
and 3.2, one of the founding members of the development team, Dr. Izchak
Miller, passed away.  This release of the game is dedicated to him by the
development and porting teams.

Version 3.2 proved to be more stable than previous versions.  Many bugs
were fixed, abuses eliminated, and game features tuned for better game
play.

SLASH V6 was picked up by Enrico Horn managed to synchronize it  with the
3.2 source.  The new SLASH 4.1.2 was released as far back as November 1996
went through at least 4 editlevels (E5, E6, E7)  with  the  latest  version
being 4.1.2E8,  synchronized with Nethack 3.2.2 and the Blackmarket option
available,  released in June 1997.

Nathan La began the arduous task of drawing  tiles  for  the SLASH monsters.

Kentaro Shirakata ported SLASH 4.1.2E8 to Unix.

Lief Clennon ported SLASH 4.1.2E8 to OS/2.

Romain Dolbeau ported SLASH 4.1.2E8 to Macintosh.

Warren Cheung combined SLASH 4.1.2 and Wizard Patch to  create SLASH'EM 0.1
in November 1997.  Several revisions including new spells and other minor
additions have led to SLASH'EM  0.0.3. Steven Uy has generously made
additional modifications.

Dirk  Schoenberger has continued updating the SLASH/SLASH'EM monster tiles.
He has also ported SLASH'EM to Linux.

Lief Clennon ported SLASH'EM to OS/2 EMX.

Kevin Hugo ported SLASH'EM to Macintosh,  and has also contributed
additional changes and improvements.

Robin Johnson finished arduous task of drawing tiles for the SLASH'EM
monsters.  He has also contributed many more new tiles.

Kevin later joined the DevTeam and incorporated the best of these ideas
in NetHack 3.3.

JNetHack (the Japanese version of NetHack) has been around since at least
1994, developed by Issei Numata and others. The GTK interface was written
for this variant and released in 1999.

Mitsuhiro Itakura headed a team which began the process of redrawing the
NetHack tiles in 8-bit color at 32x32 pixels.

The final update to 3.2 was the bug fix release 3.2.3, which was released
simultaneously with 3.3.0 in December 1999 just in time for the Year 2000.

The 3.3 development team, consisting of Michael Allison, Ken Arromdee,
David Cohrs, Jessie Collet, Steve Creps, Kevin Darcy, Timo Hakulinen,
Kevin Hugo, Steve Linhart, Ken Lorber, Dean Luick, Pat Rankin, Eric Smith,
Mike Stephenson, Janet Walz, and Paul Winner, released 3.3.0 in
December 1999 and 3.3.1 in August of 2000.

Version 3.3 offered many firsts. It was the first version to separate race
and profession. The Elf class was removed in preference to an elf race,
and the races of dwarves, gnomes, and orcs made their first appearance in
the game alongside the familiar human race.  Monk and Ranger roles joined
Archeologists, Barbarians, Cavemen, Healers, Knights, Priests, Rogues,
Samurai, Tourists, Valkyries and of course, Wizards.  It was also the first
version to allow you to ride a steed, and was the first version to have a
publicly available web-site listing all the bugs that had been discovered.
Despite that constantly growing bug list, 3.3 proved stable enough to last
for more than a year and a half.

Warren Cheung combined SLASH'EM 0.0.5E7F1 and NetHack 3.3 to create
SLASH'EM 0.0.6 and maintained the DOS and Microsoft Windows ports.

J. Ali Harlow incorporated the GTK interface and Mitsuhiro Itakura's 32x32
tileset into SLASH'EM 0.0.6 and maintained the UNIX port of SLASH'EM 0.0.6.
Peter Makholm maintained the Debian package.

Paul Hurtley maintained the MAC port of SLASH'EM 0.0.6.

The 3.4 development team initially consisted of Michael Allison, Ken Arromdee,
David Cohrs, Jessie Collet, Kevin Hugo, Ken Lorber, Dean Luick, Pat Rankin,
Mike Stephenson, Janet Walz, and Paul Winner, with Warwick Allison joining
just before the release of NetHack 3.4.0 in March 2002.

As with version 3.3, various people contributed to the game as a whole as
well as supporting ports on the different platforms that NetHack runs on:

Pat Rankin maintained 3.4 for VMS.

Michael Allison maintained NetHack 3.4 for the MS-DOS platform.
Paul Winner and Yitzhak Sapir provided encouragement.

Dean Luick, Mark Modrall, and Kevin Hugo maintained and enhanced the
Macintosh port of 3.4.

Michael Allison, David Cohrs, Alex Kompel, Dion Nicolaas, and Yitzhak Sapir
maintained and enhanced 3.4 for the Microsoft Windows platform. Alex Kompel
contributed a new graphical interface for the Windows port. Alex Kompel also
contributed a Windows CE port for 3.4.1.

Ron Van Iwaarden maintained 3.4 for OS/2.

Janne Salmijarvi and Teemu Suikki maintained and enhanced the
Amiga port of 3.4 after Janne Salmijarvi resurrected it for 3.3.1.

Christian `Marvin' Bressler maintained 3.4 for the Atari after he
resurrected it for 3.3.1.

Warren Cheung, Christian Cooper, J. Ali Harlow, Paul Hurtley, Pekka Rousu
and Darshan Shaligram combined SLASH'EM 0.0.6E5F2 and Nethack 3.4
to create SLASH'EM 0.0.7

Boolean option if USE_TILES was set at compile time (MSDOS protected mode only):
preload_tiles  control whether tiles get pre-loaded into RAM at the
               start of the game.  Doing so enhances performance
               of the tile graphics, but uses more memory.        [TRUE]

Any Boolean option can be negated by prefixing it with a '!' or 'no'.


Compound options are written as option_name:option_value.

Compound options which can be set during the game are:

boulder       override the default boulder symbol with another default: [`]
disclose      the types of information you want offered at the end of the
              game  [ni na nv ng nc]
fruit         the name of a fruit you enjoy eating  [slime mold]
              (basically a whimsy which NetHack uses from time to time).
menustyle     user interface for selection of multiple objects:
              Traditional -- one object at a time prompting;
              Combination -- prompt for classes of interest, then menu;
              Partial     -- skip class prompt, use menu of all objects;
              Full        -- menu for classes of interest, then object menu;
              only the first letter ('T','C','P','F') matters; 'N' (None)
              is a synonym for 'T', as is boolean style negation  [Full]
packorder     a list of default symbols for kinds of objects that gives the
              order in which your pack will be displayed  [")[%?+!=/(*`0_]
              (If you specify only some kinds of items, the others from the
              default order will be appended to the end.)
pickup_burden when you pick up an item that exceeds this encumberance
              level (Unburdened, Burdened, streSsed, straiNed, overTaxed,
              or overLoaded), you will be asked if you want to continue. [S]
pickup_types  a list of default symbols for kinds of objects to autopickup
              when that option is on  [all]
runmode       controls how often the map window is updated when performing
              multi-step movement (various running modes or travel command):
              teleport -- don't update map until movement stops;
              run      -- periodically update map (interval is seven steps);
              walk     -- update map after every step;
              crawl    -- like walk, but delay after making each step.
              (This only affects screen display, not actual movement.)  [run]
scores        the parts of the score list you wish to see when the game ends
              You choose a combination of top scores, scores around the top
              scores, and all of your own scores.  [!own/3 top/2 around]
suppress_alert disable various version-specific warnings about changes
              in game play or the user interface, such as notification given
              for engravings that reading is now done via 'r.'
              (e.g., use suppress_alert:0.0.7 to stop that and any other
              notifications added in that version or earlier) default: [(none)]
tileset       the name of a predefined (with TILESET=) tileset to use.  This
              option may be negated (eg., !tileset) or set to an emty value
              to disable tiles.  If the windowing port does not support the
              named tileset then a suitable alternative will be used.
              [depends on windowing port]

Compound options which may be set only on startup are:

align      Your starting alignment (align:lawful, align:neutral,
           or align:chaotic).  You may specify just the first letter.  [RANDOM]
catname    the name of your first cat  [NONE]
dogname    the name of your first dog  [NONE]
dungeon    a list of symbols to be used in place of the default ones for
           drawing the dungeon.
           The symbols are subjected to a fair amount of processing, so
           that you can use C-style escapes such as \n or \081 as well as
           indicate control characters by ^x or meta characters by \Mx.
           As usual, \ can force the next character to be taken literally.
           Since many of the default symbols are overloaded, they are
           given here by name instead of symbol, with some added notes:
           stone                               (solid rock, normally ' ')

menucolor  Set colors for menus. (menucolor:"regex_string"=color)
           If boolean option ``menucolors'' is true, menus will be shown
           with different colors.
           For example, setting ``menucolor:" blessed "=green'' shows
           all lines in a menu with the text " blessed " in green.
           The string is matched using regular expressions.
           Valid values for the color are black, red, green, brown, blue,
           magenta, cyan, gray, orange, lightgreen, yellow, lightblue,
           lightmagenta, lightcyan and white.
           You can define menucolor as many times as you wish; those
           defined later will take precedence.
           Setting menucolor has effect only if TEXTCOLOR and MENU_COLOR
           were set at compile time.  [NONE]
menu_*     create single character accelerators for menu commands.  Below

           is recommended that you spell out as much of the role name
           as possible.  You can also still denote your role by
           appending it to the "name" option (e.g., name:Vic-V), but the

Read Your Fortune
  For 50 zorkmids, the gypsy will draw a random card.  If your
  card is a suited card, you get a special fortune.  Trump cards
  each have specific effects, good or bad.

  There is no skill involved with this service; however, the
  most useful effects have an extra cost that can be only paid
  by credit.  For this reason, you may want to play the other
  games first to win enough credit for a good outcome.


Three-Card Monte
  "Let me show you the easiest game to win.  I've got these three
  cards: the ace of swords, two of swords, and three of swords.
  Watch me shuffle them in front of you.  Are you looking carefully?
  Good.  Now can you tell me which one is the ace?  That's right!
  Wasn't that easy?  Would you like to win some credit?  Just
  place a bet, and if you can pick the ace again, I'll pay your
  bet."

  Actually, it doesn't matter how carefully you watch the gypsy --
  by using slight of hand, she can control whether you win or lose.
  Your chances of winning may increase or decrease as you continue
  to play the game, depending upon whether the gypsy thinks you are
  "hooked" on the game.


Ninety-Nine
  After placing a bet, you and the gypsy are each dealt three cards.
  You alternate turns with the gypsy in which you must play one card
  from your hand, adjust a total depending on the card you played,
  and then draw a new card.  The object of the game is to force your
  opponent to play a card that makes the total less than zero or more
  than niney-nine.  The effects of the cards upon the total are as
  follows:
    Ace           Adds 1 to the total.
    2 through 10  Adds the card's value to the total.
    Jack, Queen   Subtracts 10 from the total.
    King          Raises the total to 99.  Always safe to play.
    Fool          Raises the total to 100.  Always loses.
    Other trumps  No change to the total.  Always safe to play.
  You are the first to play.  If there are no more cards left to draw
  from, you win.


Yendorian Tarocchi
  This game is still under construction, and will be released in
  a future version.

  Tarot cards originated for the purpose of playing Tarocchi, an
  Italian trick-based card game.  (Their use in fortunetelling
  and the occult began much later.)  Tarocchi has been adapted
  and renamed by other cultures: Tarot (France), Tarok (Danish),
  Troccas (Switzerland), and so on.


Pawn Gems
  You can sell valuable gems to gypsies for credit.


About the Cards
Our deck of playing cards is derived from several different European
card systems.  The Italian card system is the oldest, believed to be
imported from India, Persia, or Arabia circa 1370.  (Note that although
playing cards were invented in China, scholarly evidence indicates
that they had no direct influence on European cards.  Also, cards did
not appear in Europe until long after Marco Polo or the Crusades, so
it is unlikely that they were introduced by these travellers.)  Tarot
cards were invented during the 15th century for the purpose of playing
trick-taking card games.  They were not associated with Gypsies or the
occult until the 18th century.  Finally, there is the French card system,
which has been widely adopted by the English-speaking world.

The deck can be divided into two parts.  There are 52 "suited" cards
that are very similar to the familiar French system (4 suits with 13 ranks);
in a Tarot deck, these are called the "minor arcana".  The other part
of the deck are the "trump" cards, which are called the "major arcana" in
a Tarot deck.

Our suits are named "swords", "wands", "shields", and "rings".  These
are assigned by matching the Tarot suits to their closest equivalent
NetHack object.  Interestingly, there are two "offensive" suits (swords,
wands), two "defensive" suits (shields, rings), two "ordinary" suits
(swords, shields), and two "magical" suits (wands, rings).


                    NETHACK GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                    (Copyright 1989 M. Stephenson)

               (Based on the BISON general public license,
                   copyright 1988 Richard M. Stallman)

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
 license, but changing it is not allowed.  You can also use this wording to
 make the terms for other programs.

  The license agreements of most software companies keep you at the mercy of
those companies.  By contrast, our general public license is intended to give
everyone the right to share NetHack.  To make sure that you get the rights we
want you to have, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you
these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  Hence this license
agreement.

  Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give away
copies of NetHack, that you receive source code or else can get it if you
want it, that you can change NetHack or use pieces of it in new free
programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to
deprive anyone else of these rights.  For example, if you distribute copies
of NetHack, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You
must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you
must tell them their rights.

  Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone finds out
that there is no warranty for NetHack.  If NetHack is modified by someone
else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is
not what we distributed.

  Therefore we (Mike Stephenson and other holders of NetHack copyrights) make
the following terms which say what you must do to be allowed to distribute or
change NetHack.


                        COPYING POLICIES

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of NetHack source code as
you receive it, in any medium, provided that you keep intact the notices on
all files that refer to copyrights, to this License Agreement, and to the
absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the NetHack
program a copy of this License Agreement along with the program.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of NetHack or any portion of it, and
copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph 1 above
(including distributing this License Agreement), provided that you also do the
following:

    a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you
    changed the files and the date of any change; and

    b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is a derivative of NetHack or any part
    thereof, to be licensed at no charge to all third parties on terms
    identical to those contained in this License Agreement (except that you
    may choose to grant more extensive warranty protection to some or all
    third parties, at your option)

    c) You may charge a distribution fee for the physical act of
    transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection
    in exchange for a fee.

  3. You may copy and distribute NetHack (or a portion or derivative of it,
under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) accompany it with the complete machine-readable source code, which
    must be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

    b) accompany it with full information as to how to obtain the complete
    machine-readable source code from an appropriate archive site.  (This
    alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution.)

For these purposes, complete source code means either the full source
distribution as originally released over Usenet or updated copies of the
files in this distribution used to create the object code or executable.

  4. You may not copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer NetHack except as
expressly provided under this License Agreement.  Any attempt otherwise to
copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer NetHack is void and your rights to
use the program under this License agreement shall be automatically
terminated.  However, parties who have received computer software programs
from you with this License Agreement will not have their licenses terminated
so long as such parties remain in full compliance.


Stated plainly:  You are permitted to modify NetHack, or otherwise use parts
of NetHack, provided that you comply with the conditions specified above;
in particular, your modified NetHack or program containing parts of NetHack
must remain freely available as provided in this License Agreement.  In
other words, go ahead and share NetHack, but don't try to stop anyone else
from sharing it farther.
